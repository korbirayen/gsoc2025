            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Australian Umbrella Org for Open-Source Projects
We are an Australian not-for-profit umbrella organization for open-source projects. We believe the open-source philosophy provides a resource-efficient channel to transfer knowledge and achieve innovation and education. In 2025, we will mentor contributors on the following projects: Agora (Scala, Javascript): a library of vote-counting algorithms for democratic elections. Mind the Word (Javascript, HTML, CSS): a browser extension that helps users to learn new languages. Crowd Alert (React-Native, Expo, Jest): a cross-platform mobile application that allows users to post and view incidents around them Carbon Footprint (Javascript, HTML, CSS): a browser extension that raises environmental awareness regarding C02 emissions. Starcross (iOS, C++, OpenGL, Objective-C): Starcross is a hand-held planetarium for your iOS device. Can be used to identify stars, planets, nebulae and more. Social Street Smart (Chrome Extension): Social Street Smart is a Chrome Extension that makes the Internet a more productive place for users. Using algorithms and artificial intelligence, the extension hopes to face the major problems of the modern Internet. Monumento(Mobile Application): to provide users with a unique experience of exploring and learning more about the various monumental structures all around the world within the app. We have a diverse group of mentors, including GSoC students from previous years who decided to become long-term contributors as well as academics with extensive experience in supervising undergraduate, M.Sc. and PhD students on theses and projects, whose results are often published and presented in the most prestigious conferences of our research fields.</p>
