            <p><strong>Description:</strong> 3D CAD & other computer-aided tech (CAx)
This is the place to be if you love computer graphics. We do 2D/3D modeling, 3D printing, solid geometry, design, and more. Depending on the project, you have the opportunity to work with C/C++, Python, OpenGL, OpenCL, Qt, Javascript, and more... Help us develop open source computer-aided technologies (CAx)!


We operates as an umbrella organization with several CAx communities including:


- OpenSCAD is a solid 3D modeler with a rich syntax for programmable geometry.
- LibreCAD is a 2D modeling system specializing in blueprint-style drawings and draftings.
- IfcOpenShell is a library for working with standard IFC building model data.
- BRL-CAD is a solid modeling suite with conversion and advanced solid ray tracing features.
- Manifold is a solid geometry mesh processing library.

We want to select at least one student for each, so feel free to ask us where to start.</p>
