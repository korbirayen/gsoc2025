            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Open hardware computing for educators and makers
Enabling individuals to define the connected devices in their lives, BeagleBoard.org is the open-source, community-driven hardware precursor to Raspberry Pi, continuing to improve performance, access and openness for embedded development. The community is diverse with many professional developers utilizing the open source designs to build production solutions. Supported by a non-profit foundation, the community seeks to improve access to technology for making embedded devices using open source software and hardware. On-going developments include open designs around DSP/AI/ML accelerators, RISC-V cores, FPGA-based open hardware developement, software-defined radios, robotics/motor control, privacy-oriented personal servers, musical instruments, lighting displays, and open standards that simplify and clarify embedded systems technology.</p>
