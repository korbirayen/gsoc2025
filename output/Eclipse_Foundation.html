            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Global Open Source Foundation
The Eclipse Foundation provides our global community of individuals & organizations with a mature, scalable, and business-friendly environment for OSS collaboration and innovation. Eclipse is an open source community that's focused around key principles of transparency, openness, and vendor neutrality: the work that we do is done in a manner that can be observed by anybody with an interest; project teams welcome new ideas, and invites others to participate; and vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called "level playing field"). Naturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code. With over three hundred and sixty (https://projects.eclipse.org/) open source projects covering a diverse set of of technologies, there's something here for everybody. Eclipse projects build technology in areas such as Internet of Things (https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/internet-things), Programming Languages and IDE (https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/language), and Runtimes (https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/runtime) like Jetty and EE4J (http://www.eclipse.org/ee4j) (currently known as Java EE). For those students interested in research, we have an entire working group focused on Science (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science) where researches from some of the world's most prestigious labs do open source development to support their research areas.</p>
