            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Editor, graphics engine, & compiler for art/design
Graphite is an in-development raster and vector graphics editing suite that's free and open source. It is powered by a node graph compositing engine that fuses layers with nodes, bringing a generative, procedural approach to the workflows of artists, designers, and animators ranging from students and hobbyists to creative professionals and studios. The node-based compositing engine is built similar to a game engine. It is both a real time render pipeline and a visual programming language, complete with a custom compiler letting artists export dynamic content to other applications. Over time, Graphite intends to evolve into the "everything app" across all the common 2D creative disciplinesâ€” a versatile creation suite for graphic design, photo manipulation, digital painting, motion graphics, desktop publishing, and generative art (both procedural and AI-powered). The four-year-old project is being rapidly developed by a global team of volunteers, composed mostly of students, who are passionate about crafting high-quality code that will transform and democratize the broader 2D creative industry. The mission of Graphite strives to unshackle the creativity of every budding artist and seasoned professional by building the best comprehensive art and design tool that's accessible to all. Mission success will come when Graphite is an industry standard. A cohesive product vision and focus on innovation over imitation is the strategy that will make that possible.</p>
