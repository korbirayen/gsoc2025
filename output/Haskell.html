            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Purely functional programming language
Haskell is an advanced, general-purpose, purely functional programming language. It has a strong, static type system with Hindley-Milner type inference. The language natively supports lazy evaluation, and lets you track side effects in the type system. This leads to a concise and declarative style of programming, which differs quite a bit from conventional languages. By controlling side effects and working with immutable data, the programmer can avoid whole classes of bugs. Haskell generally compiles to fast, native code, but it can also be compiled to other targets like JavaScript (through GHCJS) or LLVM. In Google Summer of Code, we attempt to improve not only the language, but the whole ecosystem. This includes (aside from the language itself): - Compilers - Commonly used libraries - Commonly used applications written in Haskell - Profilers, debuggers and other tools - Package managers and infrastructure We have compiled an ideas list together with long-time Haskell users, compiler contributors and researchers, and as such we believe these are important projects for the industry and academia both.</p>
