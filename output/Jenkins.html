            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Jenkins, build great things at any scale
Short description: Jenkins is a popular open source automation server which is used for building, testing, CI/CD, deployment and many other use-cases. Our motto is "Build great things at any scale". Long description: Jenkins, originally founded in 2006 as "Hudson", is one of the leading automation servers. Jenkins' motto is "Build great things at any scale". Using an extensible, plugin-based architecture, developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads. As Jenkins is open-source, MIT License is used for most of the components. This year we invite potential GSoC contributors to join the Jenkins community and to work together to improve Jenkins. We have many strategic project ideas which are important to potentially hundreds of thousands of Jenkins users. The project has over 600 active contributors working on Jenkins core, plugins, website, project infrastructure, localization activities, etc. In total we have more than 2,000 components including plugins, libraries, and various utilities. The main languages in the project are Java, Groovy and JavaScript, but we also have components written in other languages (Go, C/C++, C#, etc.). Jenkins project includes multiple sub-projects (including Configuration-as-Code, Infrastructure and Remoting) and special interest groups. These entities participate in GSoC as a part of the Jenkins project. The Jenkins project is a part of Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).</p>
