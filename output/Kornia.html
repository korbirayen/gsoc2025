            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Advancing Computer Vision & Spatial AI, Openly
Kornia AI is a non-profit organisation dedicated to advancing Spatial Artificial Intelligence through open collaboration. Originally founded in 2018 and officially registered as non-profit in 2023, Kornia AI is supported by an international community of contributors who drive its projects forward. The organization was initially built around Kornia, a widely adopted Python library for Differentiable Computer Vision, which has grown to over 2 million downloads per month and has been cited more than 400 times in Google Scholar. In recent years, the core maintainers have shifted their focus to developing kornia-rs, a Rust-based variant designed for high-performance 3D computer vision applications. This native Rust implementation is optimized for industries that demand safety and memory efficiency, such as robotics, automotive, aerospace, and agtech. kornia-rs has gained significant traction in the open-source community and has been adopted by leading companies, including Farm-ng, Inc., Rerun.io, and Copper Robotics, which have featured the project on their platforms.</p>
