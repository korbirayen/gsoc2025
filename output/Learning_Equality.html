            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Building equity in education to transform lives
Learning Equality is an education technology nonprofit that develops and maintains Kolibri, an adaptable set of open solutions specially designed to support teaching and learning with technology but without the Internet for the half of the world that still lacks access to connectivity. Kolibri is centered around an offline-first learning platform that runs on a variety of low-cost and legacy devices. It is complemented by a curricular tool, a library of open educational materials, and a toolkit of resources to support training and implementation. These tools are open and available in a variety of languages, to better support learners and educators globally. As a community-driven nonprofit, Learning Equality works closely to co-design Kolibri with a core network of collaborators, including national NGOs, UN agencies, government, and corporate partners. We also adopt a needs-based approach, constantly gathering insights from our community to inform the development of our tools. Through its do-it-yourself adoption model and strategic collaborations, Kolibri has reached learners and educators in more than 220 countries and territories since its launch in 2017. Given our offline access and distribution model, we learn about usage of Kolibri through a combination of telemetry ping backs of high level, aggregate, anonymized statistics, data from partners, and use of our Kolibri Data Portal. Since instances of Kolibri never need to connect to the Internet to be used, we do not know about usage across every instance, which is why this is an informed estimate from years of data.</p>
