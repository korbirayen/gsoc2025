            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Look at the Universe with the power of Open Source
OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy, astrophysics & heliophysics projects that are used by researchers and software engineers around the world to study our universe either by analysing the data obtained from amazing instruments like the [James Webb Space telescope](https://jwst.nasa.gov/), the [Square Kilometer Array](https://www.skatelescope.org/) or the [Solar Dynamic Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), developing very sophisticated numerical models (eg., [FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft. The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research, from being able to forecast solar storms to detecting planets in other stars, to understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe. OpenAstronomy currently consists of [18 projects](https://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools, the range of which is wide. For example: - [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data, reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; - [SunPy](https://sunpy.org/) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with access to the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis tools and visualisation code; - [Julia Astro](https://juliaastro.org/dev/index.html) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia; - And more! As a single organisation, we strive to strengthen collaborations between each sub-organisation, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our "sister" projects. With the goal being unification of standards and libraries to enable true multidisciplinary research.</p>
