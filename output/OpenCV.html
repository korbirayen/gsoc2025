            <p><strong>Description:</strong> beneficial uses of computer vision in society
OpenCV promotes the beneficial uses of computer vision in society primarily through maintaining a state-of-the-art open and free code base and via courseware, contests, workshops and conferences. OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library includes state of the art computer vision and deep learning algorithms (including running deep networks) and apps. It is professionally coded and optimized. It can be used in C++, Python, javascipt, Julia, Cuda, OpenCL and Matlab. It runs on: Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and MacOS and many embedded implementations such as Raspberry Pi, Movidius, and RISC-V.</p>
