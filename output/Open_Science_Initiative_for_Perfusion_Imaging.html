            <p><strong>Slogan:</strong> Open access resources for perfusion imaging</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Open access resources for perfusion imaging
Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital medical imaging technique that assesses blood flow in tissues and thus contributes crucial information for diagnosing conditions such as stroke, tumors, and neurological disorders. Unlike the standard MRI methods that are daily used in hospitals, raw perfusion MRI data require further processing and quantification. This requires dedicated software tools. However, the lack of standardization and the availability of standardized and tested analysis code makes perfusion MRI less accessible and hinders its widespread use. The ISMRM Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI) aims to address this gap and create resources for best practices in perfusion MRI including software and data inventories, code repositories, challenges, and educational material.</p>
