            <p><strong>Slogan:</strong> The community open to science and technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The community open to science and technology.
Open Science Labs is a global community dedicated to creating an open space for teaching, learning, and sharing information about open science and computational tools. Our community develops tools that address real-world problems and collaborates with other projects and workgroups to improve technology and create international opportunities for our community. Although our focus may seem broad, we initially prioritize supporting Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who often face computational challenges in their work. We recognize that many colleagues in scientific fields may not be familiar with programming languages, computational libraries, version control systems, databases, DevOps, and other computational tools. Therefore, we aim to provide a safe and open space for individuals to learn and share their knowledge. Our community is open to everyone, including students, professors, and industry professionals, as we believe that the challenges and technologies used in these fields are frequently similar, if not the same (in many cases).</p>
