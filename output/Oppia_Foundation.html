The Oppia project aims to empower learners across the globe by providing access to high-quality, engaging education. We envision a world where access to high-quality education is not a privilege but a human right. The team works on two platforms: (a) Oppia Web, which provides an online learning tool that enables anyone to learn from effective and engaging interactive lessons (called 'explorations'), which simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor. This format makes it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback. The Oppia Web platform also provides the infrastructure needed to support lesson creation and translation. (b) Oppia Android, which provides a way for these lessons to be played offline on an Android app that supports low-end devices and does not require Internet connectivity. As a community, we are also aware that millions of students in underserved communities lack access to the educational resources necessary to effectively learn key skills like basic numeracy. Thus, in addition to developing the Oppia platform, the team has launched and continues to develop a set of free and effective lessons on basic mathematics, supplemented by translations and voiceovers. Students using these lessons have shown strong improvements between pre-and post-tests, and weâ€™ve received lots of positive feedback on them. We are planning to extend this offering to other subjects, based on what students (and the nonprofits working with them) tell us would be most useful.</p>
