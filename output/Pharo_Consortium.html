            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Modern and immersive programming language
Pharo is a dynamic, purely object-oriented programming language (where everything is an object) that is inspired by Smalltalk. It also includes a powerful IDE that focuses on simplicity and quick feedback. Its entire syntax can fit on a postcard, and you can code directly in the debugger. Pharo has useful tools that help you work efficiently. The goal of Pharo is to provide a clean, innovative, free, and open-source environment. With a stable and small core system, great development tools, and regular updates, Pharo is a good choice for building and running important applications. Pharo supports a healthy community made up of both private and commercial contributors who help improve and maintain the core system and its external packages.</p>
