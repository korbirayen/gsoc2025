            <h1>QC Devs</h1>
            <p><strong>Slogan:</strong> Sustainable software for quantum chemistry & more</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> python, github, c++, julia, jupyter</p>
            <p><strong>Topic:</strong> data science, scientific visualization, quantum chemistry, Computational Science, numerical algorithms</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> QC-Devs develops free, open-source, and cross-platform libraries for the computational sciences, focusing on theoretical and computational chemistry. Our goal is to make programming accessible to students and researchers, to catalyze scientific collaborations, and to promote precepts of sustainable software development. We're adapting some of the same principles to develop free and open-source educational materials (qc-edu.org) to modernize scientific education by integrating hands-on computation and computer programming.</p>
