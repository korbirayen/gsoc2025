            <p><strong>Slogan:</strong> Adventure and RPG preservation project</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> python, opengl, c++, assembly, php</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> ScummVM is a game preservation project with a quickly growing code base since more than 20 years. Originally focused on 2D Point&Click adventure games, its scope widened in 2016 to RPG thanks to successful GSoC students and to 3D games in 2020 after the merge with its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.</p>
