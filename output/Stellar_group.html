            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The STE||AR Group is an international team of researchers who understand that a new approach to parallel computation is needed. Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow. This organization aims to support, coordinate, and distribute research done in this area by creating a marketplace of ideas where concepts are debated and solutions are transparently developed.</p>
