            <h1>Stichting SU2</h1>
            <p><strong>Slogan:</strong> Computational Fluid Dynamics and Optimization</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> python, c++</p>
            <p><strong>Topic:</strong> aerodynamics, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Multi-Disciplinary Optimization, Adjoint Design Optimization, Fluid Dynamics</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Computational analysis tools have revolutionized the way we design engineering systems as a society, but most established codes are proprietary, unavailable, or prohibitively expensive for many users. The SU2 Foundation will change this, making multiphysics analysis and design optimization software free and publicly available, in a single place, without restriction on who can contribute to its creation and development. The SU2 Foundation is an educational and scientific not-for-profit that will bring together computational scientists and engineers through the SU2 Foundation platform. The SU2 Foundation develops, maintains, and supports a collection of C++ and Python-based software tools for performing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) analysis and solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. Through maintaining and improving the quality of software, documentation, and tutorials, and by growing the community of users and developers, the SU2 Foundation will ensure quality improvement of multiphysics software tools, accessible by everyone, for continued innovation in the engineering sciences.</p>
