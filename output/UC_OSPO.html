            <h1>UC OSPO</h1>
            <p><strong>Slogan:</strong> Amplifying Research Impact through Open Source</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> python, javascript, c/c++, machine learning, VLSI</p>
            <p><strong>Topic:</strong> education, bioinformatics, hardware, data science, AI/ML</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The UCSC Open Source Program Office (OSPO) supports open source work throughout the University of California system. Beginning in 2022, we took over the programmatic responsibilities of the UCSC Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS), including mentorship activities such as GSoC. Following in line with the earlier work of CROSS, the OSPO creates partnerships with stakeholders within and outside the UC system in order to help students learn from open source communities, support scientists in using open source to accelerate research efforts, and connect students and scientists with sponsors from industry, government, and foundations. The OSPO helps bridge the gap between academic research and successful open source projects by promoting innovative projects maintained by UC-affiliated scientists and researchers. We support the transfer of cutting-edge technology resulting from UC-originating research to industry via successful open source projects. Due to the multi-campus nature of our current efforts, the projects we support and promote cover a wide range of topics and technologies - including: - Open Source Hardware and Chip Design - AI / Machine Learning - Storage Systems and Devices - Data Science and visualization - Performance analysis - Reproducibility - Cloud-based computation All of our mentors are scientists and researchers who are actively involved in one or more of these open source projects.</p>
