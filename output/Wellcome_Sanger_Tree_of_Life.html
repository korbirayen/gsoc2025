            <h1>Wellcome Sanger Tree of Life</h1>
            <p><strong>Slogan:</strong> Genome analysis for all species</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> python, machine learning, natural language processing, nextflow, Cloud Storage</p>
            <p><strong>Topic:</strong> machine learning, genomics, bioinformatics, genome analysis</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Two scientific units of the Sanger Institute are focusing their effort on non-human genomics, encompassing all organisms on Earth. The Tree of Life programme is generating high-quality reference genome assemblies for thousands of species, and releasing them to the community to help decipher genome function and organisation, and improve our understanding of biodiversity. Novel software and methods are required for the processing of this vast amount of data. The Genomic Surveillance Unit improves global human health by accelerating the use and impact of genomic surveillance, for instance to fight malaria. It delivers products, tools, and services that empower public health partners to add genomic information to decision-making.</p>
