            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Free and open wireless networks
We unite wireless communities accross Europe like Freifunk, Ninux, qaul.net, Guifi.net, and Evernet e.G. Our communities either build decentralized wireless networks based on embedded networking hardware or extensively rely on FOSS components such as OpenWRT Linux, OLSR, BATMAN, Babel mesh routing daemons, libremesh, or retroshare applications. The contributions are made by individuals as well as local groups which are highly motivated to build open and free wireless networks providing Internet access to everybody. Moreover, we also create solutions that allow anonymous and secure communication. The majority of our networks devices are based on affordable, off-the-shelf WiFi home routers. The Freifunk operating system extends the OpenWrt Linux OS by new kernel and driver features, additional software packages that enable for instance multi-hop wireless mesh networking and new P2P communication features.</p>
