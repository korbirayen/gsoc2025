            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Makers' choice for sysadmins, developers & users
The openSUSE Project is a worldwide effort that promotes the use of Linux, tools around it, and open source. The openSUSE community is made up of multiple contributing communities that collaborate as part of a global open-source network. The openSUSE community develops, builds and maintains many of the packages, tools and infrastructure for the distribution. The community works together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as part of the global Free and Open Source Software community. openSUSE creates one of the world's best Linux distributions, as well as a variety of tools, such as OBS, OpenQA, Kiwi, YaST, OSEM and Uyuni. Distributions include a rolling release (Tumbleweed), a stable annual release (Leap) and operating systems for edge, embedded, cloud and containers through MicroOS and ALP. The project is controlled by its community and relies on the contributions of individuals, working as testers, writers, translators, usability experts, artists and ambassadors or developers. The project embraces a wide variety of technology, people with different levels of expertise, speaking different languages and having different cultural backgrounds.</p>
